This submission includes python scripts implementing three triplet extractors:
POS-based extractor: Identifies triplets based on part-of-speech tags.
Dependency-based extractor: Utilizes dependency trees for triplet extraction.
LLM-based extractor: Uses a Large Language Model (Gemini-pro)
via API calls for triplet generation.
The main() function runs all extractors on three Wikipedia pages: Donald Trump,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and J.K. Rowling, and prints the results.

Approach:
The code employs Spacy for POS tagging and dependency parsing and the Wikipedia API to fetch text.
Extractors were evaluated for precision and recall using manually verified triplets.
The LLM extractor uses a structured prompt to generate results and is compared against the classic methods.
Results can be reproduced by running the code file.
